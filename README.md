# Welcome!

I realized in my project import contacts and showing details about contact. I used the **MVC** architecture pattern. I didn't use xib\Storyboard in the project.

### Used frameworks

 - UIKit
 - Contacts

### Implemented

 - Import contacts
 - Displaying the contact list
 - Displaying contact details
 - Sort order
 - Localization

## Demo
<img alt="demo element" src="Demo/Demo.gif" width="380" />
